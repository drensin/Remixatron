# Remixatron Web UI
(c) 2017-2025 - Dave Rensin - drensin@gmail.com

Creates an infinite remix of an audio file by finding musically similar beats and computing a randomized play path through them. The default choices should be suitable for a variety of musical styles. This work is inspired by the Infinite Jukebox (http://www.infinitejuke.com) project creaeted by Paul Lamere (paul@spotify.com)

It groups musically similar beats of a song into clusters and then plays a random path through the song that makes musical sense, but not does not repeat. It will do this infinitely.

This is a web ui version of the CLI found at [main page](https://github.com/drensin/Remixatron). Please see the [README.md](https://github.com/drensin/Remixatron/blob/master/README.md) at that site for a deeper explanation of how it all works under the hood.

# Requirements
You must have these installed for this to work.
1) ffmpeg
2) yt-dlp
3) Python >=3.6 <= 3.10

# Installation
The easiest way to run Remixatron is via a Docker container (see below). If you want to install it locally, then please use a virtual environment system like conda. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download and download the installer for your platform then do the following:

```
# create a new environment with Python 3.10, because anything 
# above it will break

conda create -n Remixatron python=3.10  

# activate it

conda activate Remixatron

```
next, run these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/drensin/Remixatron.git  
cd "Remixatron/Web UI"  
pip install --upgrade pip  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```    
On Windows make sure you add the following directories to your Path:

    # The directory where you installed ffmpeg.exe, eg:
    C:\ffmpeg\bin 
    # The python subdirectory where yt-dlp.exe was installed, eg:
    C:\Users\Name\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python36\Scripts 

# Running
    python3 main.py

**NOTE:**  This program uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) - a more performant fork of youtube-dl, which is updated A LOT. I strongly reccommend that you periodically make sure that you have the latest and greatest yt-dlp installed before launching the server each time.

# Running from a Prebuilt Docker Conatiner

Managing python dependencies is a pain, so I built a public Remixatron container. If you're comfortable running docker, then you can just run this command:

    docker run -p 8000:8000 drensin/remixatron:latest

# Building Your Own Docker Image

Alternatively, a dockerfile is provided in case you want to build your own.

## Instalation
    docker build -t remixatron -f dockerfile .
## Running
    docker run -p 8000:8000 remixatron

# Connecting

Just navigate to http://localhost:8000 with a browser running on the same machine as the server. If you want to connect from another machine on your LAN, then you'll need to edit the cors.cfg file to allow it. For example, suppose your computer is named *mymachine.local*, the correct CORS config to allow it and localhost will be:

    {
	"ORIGINS":["http://localhost:8000",
               "http://mymachine.local:8000"]
    }

Now, you should be able to go to any machine on your home network and navigate to *http://mymachine.local:8000/* and use the app.
