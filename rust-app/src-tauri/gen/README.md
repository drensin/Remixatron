# Generated Code (`src-tauri/gen/`)

This directory contains platform-specific code generated by the Tauri CLI, typically for mobile targets (Android/iOS).

## Context
In Tauri v2, when you add mobile targets (`tauri android init` or `tauri ios init`), the bindings and platform-specific project structures (Gradle, Xcode) are often managed here or referenced here.

**Warning**: Files in this directory are often auto-generated. Manual edits may be overwritten by the CLI.
